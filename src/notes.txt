    -Explore what I need to do to use heredity in CSS.  Max 1 hour, option to continue if I feel like I am close to the answer.
        -I am not close to an answer.

    -Organize the tables so that inputs <th> and <tr> use a similar structure

    -Make the tables use a flex-basis so I can alter the sizes.

    -Table should be universal.  Lots of other parts of the app use a table, and I want them all to be configurations of this.

        -Some <td> will be components.
        -Some <td> will have multiple elements
        -Need to be able to take unknown number of <td> in each <tr>
        -Incorporate flex-basis into <th>


Auto space:  74 + 28 (102) + x = 231   x = 129

10% space:  35 + 28 (63) + x = 138     x = 75

---

Auto space:  74 + 28 (102) + x = 312   x = 210

10% space:  35 + 28 (63) + x = 139     x = 76

OK, so... kind of! 138.5 = 10% of total page width of 1385.
