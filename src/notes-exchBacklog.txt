Creating a separate backlog for Exch items I need to do at some point so I don't have to look through that ass-long NNotes file for it.

-Since the warning text and my buttons need to use the same column space, it could be nice to integrate them into a single component.

-Add in ability to specify Pickup Qty with ChooseExchangeItems.

-productDetails needs to be able to accept an empty / mostly empty item.
