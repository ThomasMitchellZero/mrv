    I think we need to tracking three states: Unmatched Items, Unmatched Purchases, Matches.

    ENTER ITEM:
        ItemNum{
            qty,
            product-details
        }

        if: Unmatched Items contains that item number, += the quantity 
        else: add that item to the Unmatched Items

    OK.  I think I can fix the item part for now.  


    DELETE ITEM:
             it all goes away.

    //Receipts section IS NOT FIGURED OUT.  I am leaving this here so I don't get stuck for the day.

    The hard part is that I need to organize the receipt in such a way that I can easily check check items and their quantities against the list of scanned items...

    But I also need a way to easily delete every item that came on the receipt.

        Enter Receipt:
            Each receipt will have some metadata (date, invoice num, etc.) and then an array of the items purchased.

            [itemNum1, ItemNum2, etc]

            ItemNum: {
                Invoice:
                Prices: {
                    "12.99": 3,
                "14.50": 4,
                }
            }

            If there is a matching itemNum and price, Qty ++.  Otherwise, add a new price: quantity key-value pair.

            I think I can use the Object.entries() method to get the keys if I need them.  I don't have to get super into it now, but if I want there are ways to sort the keys, so I could start with highest first.

            //Also, if I don't account for the edge case where an invoice has the same item at multiple prices, this gets a lot easier.

            A thought.  Maybe this is hacky, but I could make each key a string composed of    "ItemNum-price-transaction": quantity
            
            and then parse the string apart for comparison?  That's also fairly easy to sort?

            or, I make the ReceiptedItems like:

            {
                ItemNum: 100
                price: 12.99
                quantity: 10
            }






        MATCH RECEIPT
            For each receipt item:
                If there is a matching item number in the Scanned Items Session:

        

        DELETE RECEIPT
            I think the way to do this is: when I delete a receipt, go through the Unmatched Receipts list, find each item that matches the ItemNum and price, and then delete that many.  Maybe I don't need to keep track of how many are going in?
