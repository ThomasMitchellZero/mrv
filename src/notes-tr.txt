Since I am starting Vyvanse, I want to do some trip reports and subjectively compare it to the Adderall.  I really do need to be as honest as I can.  The goal is to have the drug that lets me be my best, so it's important to describe honestly and accurately.

Rule 1:  Document, don't expound. Accurately describe what you feel, but no more.  Time spent here is time not spent on real work.  Remember that writing is fun, but it's still technically a time-waster.

    -8:00 dosed.  I probably should be in the habit of dosing right when I wake up, but I can't re-dose and I'm afraid of running out of fuel.

    -9:45:  + ~1.5 cups of coffee.  Good is that I feel energetic and alert and fast, subjectively more than Adderall within the same time window.  Bad is that a LOT of things look interesting.  I was actually ready to go at 9:00 and just spent the last 45 minutes looking at Soviet airplane bureaus on Wikipedia -_-  Had a protein shake and appetite is basically nil so I REALLY need to remember to eat on time.  Like, seriously.  That's a task that is so easy that I fail so much, and it really does have consequences.  The cost is that feeling of being just out of gas at 3:00.  It's not like I eat and then minutes later the problem is gone.  It can easily take an hour to recover, and that whole time I'm losing momentum.

    -9:55.  I actually feel REALLY good.  I'm ready to tear into this work.  This was not how I felt an hour ago, so this drug takes some time to spin up.

    10:30 *  
        Not actually a lot to show so far, so I need to keep that in mind.  I do really have this sense of tantalizing patterns to be grasped, just outside my reach.  Like if I had another 10 IQ points I could figure out some cool patterns in this program.
            -Another way to put it - I feel like my intuition is outpacing my comprehension.  

    11:45 * 
        Not specific to Vyvanse but based on my initial observations this a problem that I need to create a pattern or a mind-tool to address:  How to point my interest at the right thing?  Like, every time I find myself reaching for something non-work, I KNOW that I'll regret it later (sometimes REALLY regret it) but I do it anyways.
            -One idea is to create a document to record things that catch my interest for later.  Like when I looked up the Flying Flapjack, part of my motivation was 'Well, I won't remember to look at this later'.  Maybe if I have a repository for all that, it will let me put it in and then get back to work?

        -Again, just a sense:  I feel like my avoidance of hard problems is still present, but in a more insidious way - like I'm able to find better justifications for doing things I'm not supposed to be doing.

        -Still TBD, but my current subjective sense of Different From Normal is much greater than the Adderall.  Definitely more of a feeling of I Took A Drug.

        -More sore throat, sweating, and bruxism than Adderall.  

    12:50
        -Had lunch, back in the chair.  My energy feels less potent but more controlled right now.  I don't feel my mind pinging off in different directions anymore.
    
    2:00
        -Definitely less energy than this morning.  Actually feeling heavier than usual right now.  However, I do notice that when I'm not actively thinking, my attention is inactive rather than running around looking for some stimulation.

    3:20
        -Just want to put in a marker to remind myself to record how this goes.  I'm trying to sort out the conditional logic for what user interface to display as the refund tenders are processed in sequence.  This is a hard problem with a lot of possible solutions and many different factors to weigh and balance.
