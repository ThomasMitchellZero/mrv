Since I am starting Vyvanse, I want to do some trip reports and subjectively compare it to the Adderall.  I really do need to be as honest as I can.  The goal is to have the drug that lets me be my best, so it's important to descrive honestly and accurately.

Rule 1:  Document, don't expound. Accurately describe what you feel, but no more.  Time spent here is time not spent on real work.  Remember that writing is fun, but it's still technically a time-waster.

    -8:00 dosed.  I probably should be in the habit of dosing right when I wake up, but I can't re-dose and I'm afraid of running out of fuel.

    -9:45:  + ~1.5 cups of coffee.  Good is that I feel energetic and alert and fast, subjectively more than Adderall within the same time window.  Bad is that a LOT of things look interesting.  I was actually ready to go at 9:00 and just spent the last 45 minutes looking at Soviet airplane companies on Wikipedia -_-  Had a protein shake and appetite is basically nil so I REALLY need to remember to eat on time.  Like, seriously.  That's a task that is so easy that I fail so much, and it really does have consequences.  The cost is that feeling of being just out of gas at 3:00.  It's not like I eat and then minutes later the problem is gone.  It can easily take an hour to recover, and that whole time I'm losing momentum.

    -9:55.  I actually feel REALLY good.  I'm ready to tear into this work.

    10:30.  Not actually a lot to show so far, so I need to keep that in mind.  I do really have this sense of tantalizing patterns to be grasped, just outside my reach.  Like if I had another 10 IQ points I could figure out some cool patterns in this program.
        -Another way to put it - I feel like my intuition is outpacing my comprehension.
