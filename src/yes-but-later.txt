-What is a 'dark night of the soul' with meditation?

-Try and think of some sort of routine or practice like 42069 to get myself to want to work?

-Meaning of code-smell?

-Elegant React?  If not, is Elegant Javascript worthwhile?

    -List and describe tactics for outwitting my ADD (first entry, this yes-but-later file!)

    -Think about systematized approaches to handle wheel-spinning or that thing we do where we're just aimlessly looking around the code when we are stuck.  Kind of like the 'field-cutting' approach to bug fixes?

    -It seems like the rate at which we are discovering anti-ADD weapons is increasing.  Analyze?

    -Ponder why I don't seek out more work at work.  I'm generally happier when overtaxed instead of underused.

    -Come up with a stomach-acid management approach.  Factors to consider:
        -Does food acidity meaningfully effect stomach acidity?
        -With how Vyvanse is absorbed, do I need to de-acidify on an extended basis to have an effect?
        -If lower acidity = lower protein absorbtion, how does that affect my muscle/nutrition goals?

    -Come up with a clear description of what is different about implications of Status vs. Type in Tenders.  I think there's a programming heuristic to be found in there.  

    -I can never destroy my ADD.  But I can get better at defeating it.

-Since we now have a clear understanding of why not to do programmatic state changes in useEffect (it's redundant) this would be a fun little section to write later.  

-What is the deal with Cruella De Vil?  It seems like we have a very incomplete story.  Where does her money come from, and why does this coat matter so much to her? How does she know Roger and Anita?  If someone described a person like her to me in real life I would expect I was being lied to.  


-For the next 69420, instead of discarding distractions, I want to try just focusing on one thing, like breathing, for 69 secons.

-How did binary start getting used in computer science?

-With money, and showing dollar values in cents.  Why does that work for not generating recurring decimal values?  We're still doing division, right?
    -OK, I think I kind of brain-farted here.  This does make sense to me.  Because every price is measured in cents, every price is a whole number.  When we divide by 100, we move the decimal place two spaces, but that never generates an irrational number.  (Why?  Is it a base 10 thing?)

    -We SHOULD also never be doing division.  It should just be multiplication.  When you multiply, by definition you cannot LOSE prime factors, so if [n] is divisible by 7, any number multiplied by [n] will also have 7 as a factor.  

    I guess the exception would be percentage-based discounts.  Those could still generate irrational numbers.

-Write my little amateur dissertation on how horns work.  Roman horn > bugle > trombone > French horn.

-Learning to love, or at least accept, the ugly win.  In many games, the size of the win does not matter.  That's why pulling the goalie when you're down with a minute left is a good play.  Be awayre of what kind of game you are in. (Rest at the campfire, or upgrade with 16 health and an Elite coming up?)

-I recently quit when I got three bad boss relics (Crown, Ecto, and Choker in a discard deck)  That should indicate to me that I still don't love the Ugly Win.  My thought should be 'It would take someone special to salvage this run'.  To an observer, would look a bit heroic.

-A toss that eludes some blockers but is harder to hit might just be lower EV because Ushijima is good enough to beat blockers.

-Figure out what Semi can do that would be good for a different team but is worse for STZ.

-Write about humility when learning, not seeking validation and trying to show what you know.  I think the 'seeking validation' is most important to explore because when I think about showing my code to Tejas, what I really want to hear is 'This is really good!  You are very advanced!'  If goal is truly to LEARN, optimize for learning.

-Research, buy some slipper socks.

-Onaga

-Try to figure out why Onaga keeps ending up at the bottom of the pile, specifically ahead of Kindaichi.  Is it just uncertainty discount?
