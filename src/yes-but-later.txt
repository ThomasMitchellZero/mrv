-What is a 'dark night of the soul' with meditation?

-Try and think of some sort of routine or practice like 42069 to get myself to want to work?

-Meaning of code-smell?

-Elegant React?  If not, is Elegant Javascript worthwhile?

    -List and describe tactics for outwitting my ADD (first entry, this yes-but-later file!)

    -Think about systematized approaches to handle wheel-spinning or that thing we do where we're just aimlessly looking around the code when we are stuck.  Kind of like the 'field-cutting' approach to bug fixes?

    -It seems like the rate at which we are discovering anti-ADD weapons is increasing.  Analyze?

    -Ponder why I don't seek out more work at work.  I'm generally happier when overtaxed instead of underused.

    -Come up with a stomach-acid management approach.  Factors to consider:
        -Does food acidity meaningfully effect stomach acidity?
        -With how Vyvanse is absorbed, do I need to de-acidify on an extended basis to have an effect?
        -If lower acidity = lower protein absorbtion, how does that affect my muscle/nutrition goals?

    -Come up with a clear description of what is different about implications of Status vs. Type in Tenders.  I think there's a programming heuristic to be found in there.  

    -I can never destroy my ADD.  But I can get better at defeating it.

-Look up what's inside Vyvanse.  See if dissolving in water has any affect.

-Since we now have a clear understanding of why not to do programmatic state changes in useEffect (it's redundant) this would be a fun little section to write later.  

-What is the deal with Cruella De Vil?  It seems like we have a very incomplete story.  How does she know Roger and Anita?  If someone described a person like her to me in real life I would expect I was being lied to.  

-Check some reviews of Ace of the Diamond.
